# StageNet-Paper-Replication

In this code, we aim to replicate the study by Junyi Gao, Cao Xiao, Yasha Wang, Wen Tang, Lucas M. Glass, and Jimeng Sun (2020) to demonstrate that a stage-aware model is superior at predicting decompensation in patients compared to benchmark models.

We will use the benchmark code by Hrayr Harutyunyan, Hrant Khachatrian, David C. Kale, Greg Ver Steeg, and Aram Galstyan (Harutyunyan2019) to create our dataset for testing the StageNet model.

For preliminary results, we will test the pre-trained StageNet model against our selected test set consisting of around 100 patients. In the full version of the replication, we will rebuild the StageNet model from the ground up and train it with the specified epochs and parameters to verify its results.
